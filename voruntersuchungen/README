Voruntersuchungen zum Entwurf einer Scherbenklassifikation

#pRFA / XFA Dataset
CRMC: Ceramic Atlas of central Europe, see folder for R script and visualization

#3D Objects 
3D Models (https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/archaide_2019/overview.cfm) from the Archaide Projekt (http://www.archaide.eu/).
Rust-Tool to evaluate the change of curvature along two main axes of a 3D models.

Compute the Wasserstein 1D distance to compare the resulting vectors among all models and a tSNE embedding implementation 
to get a grafical representation of the distance matrix.

The tSNE Cluster output is turned into a interactive Webpage (mouseover of the cluster points gives the model name wich is to the same time the type of amphora, 
click on a cluster point opens up the dataset and the 3D model): http://ecomparatio.net/~khk/scherben/
